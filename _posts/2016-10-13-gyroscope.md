I recently signed up for [Gyrosco.pe][], a quantified-self dashboard. I really love the interface and the data they pull in, but I have some features on my my wishlist...

1. **Android app** - I really want an Android app...the mobile site is nowhere near as polished as the iPhone or Web App. Also, you can't share data or visualizations from it. That said, it is on their roadmap, so all I have to do is wait.
2. **Calendar** - I want to be able to connect to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) and add my events to the daily timeline.
3. **Email** - Email is still used widely, and so Gmail/Exchange integration is an absolute must. Other communication media should follow suit, like [Slack](https://slack.com/) and the dozens of extant messaging apps.
4. **More free features** - The Zero theme hasn't been updated in months; it looks like pro users are getting all the cool new stuff. Adding more free features (sleep tracking from wearables, more visualizations) would incentivize users to pay for the pro subscription.
